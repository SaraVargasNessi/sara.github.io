    <h4>SHADOWS</h4>
      <p>A series of images conceptualizing the ephemeral aspect of thoughts and moments. 
          “Shadows” highlights the beauty of an everyday element that is often lost in the background. At the same time, the project explores 
          the positive and negative beliefs associated with light and shadows, showing both as equally important and necessary for balance. 
          The artwork shows shadows as a symbol of the challenges necessary for growth, breaking away from their usual preconceptions. 
          After all, just as there would be no shadows without light, we only understand light because we know darkness. 
          The final piece is a multi-layered artwork combining analog and digital techniques to allow others to witness these unique moments in time.

    <h4>LIGHT SOURCE</h4>
    <p>"Light Source" is a two-story installation mural measuring approximately 22’ tall and 95’ long.
        Sara Vargas Nessi integrated traditional and digital art by photographing natural light and shadows 
        over her acrylic paintings. The artwork symbolizes a story being told along the wall by images that were 
        captured to allow others to witness a unique instant in time. The photographs were printed and dry-mounted 
        onto aluminum panels. 'Light Source' is displayed in the lobby of Centennial College's Story Arts Centre 
        campus (951 Carlaw Ave, Toronto, Canada).
