              <h4>SUNLIGHT (2023)</h4>
                <p> A series of photographs that conceptualize the ephemeral aspect of thoughts and moments. Sara’s solo exhibition brings attention to the small things in life using natural light and shadows as reminders of what is always present around us, but we sometimes take them for granted. The non-representational paintings shown under the intervention of light and shadows are captured to allow others to witness these moments.
                    <br> <br>
                    “Sunlight” is a direct reference to Sara's first solo exhibition at Runnymede Library (2016), where her ongoing project “Shadows” started.
                    <br> <br>
                    The exhibition will run through the entire month of September. Read Akimbo post here.
